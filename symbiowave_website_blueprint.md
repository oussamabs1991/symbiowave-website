# SymbioWave Website Design & Technical Blueprint

## 1. Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to design and develop a cutting-edge website for SymbioWave, a company specializing in Artificial Conscious Intelligence (ACI). The website will serve as the main digital presence, showcasing its technology, ecosystem, impact, and vision for the future where biology converges with intelligence.

## 2. Visual Identity & Aesthetics

*   **Background Color Guidelines:**
    *   Predominantly dark, organic gradient: `linear-gradient(to bottom, #0A1628, #000000)` (Bio-Blue Dark to Black).
    *   Creates a sense of depth, mystery, and focus on content.
    *   Lighter, muted versions of primary/secondary colors for section backgrounds where appropriate, ensuring readability.
*   **Text Color Guidelines:**
    *   Default Body Text: Light gray/off-white (e.g., `#E0E0E0` or `#F0F0F0`) for contrast against the dark background.
    *   Headings: Neural Gold Light (`#FBBF24`) or Bio-Blue Light (`#3B82F6`) for emphasis.
    *   Interactive/Link Text: Bio-Blue Light (`#3B82F6`) or Organic Green Light (`#34D399`).

### Typography

*   **Headlines (H1, H2, H3):**
    *   Font Characteristics: Ultra-modern, geometric sans-serif with slight bio-organic curves. Clean lines, high readability, futuristic feel with a touch of organic softness. (Conceptual description)
    *   Weight: Bold, Medium.
    *   Size: Large, impactful, scaled appropriately for hierarchy.
*   **Body Text (Paragraphs, lists, general content):**
    *   Font Characteristics: Clean, highly legible sans-serif. Balanced x-height, good spacing for readability on digital screens. (Conceptual description)
    *   Weight: Regular.
    *   Size: Standard (e.g., 16px-18px base).
*   **Code/Tech Elements (Code snippets, technical labels):**
    *   Font Characteristics: Monospaced font with clear distinction between characters (e.g., 0 vs O, 1 vs l). (Conceptual description)
    *   Weight: Regular.
    *   Size: Slightly smaller than body text, or same size depending on context.

    *(Note: Actual font selection will require choosing specific font files like 'Inter', 'Roboto Mono', 'Orbitron', 'Geomanist', or similar, based on availability and licensing. The descriptions above are conceptual guidelines.)*

### Iconography & Graphics

*   **Key Themes:**
    *   Cellular Patterns: Hexagonal grids, network structures, abstracted cellular imagery.
    *   Bio-inspired Shapes: Flowing lines, organic curves, leaf-like structures, neural network diagrams.
    *   Futuristic Elements: Sleek interfaces, abstract data visualizations, glowing accents, subtle geometric overlays.
*   **ACI (Artificial Conscious Intelligence) Representations (Visual Metaphors for 10 ACI Models):**
    *   Each ACI model should have a distinct but thematically related icon/graphic. Icons should be abstract, modern, and incorporate elements from the key themes. They should hint at the ACI model's core function or concept. (Detailed visual metaphors for each of the 10 models to be developed based on their specific functions, e.g., "OracleMind" - radiant neural network; "BioSynth" - DNA helix with digital circuits).

## 3. Animations & Interactions

### Entrance Animations

*   **Page Load Animation:** Subtle fade-in of main content, gentle expansion/reveal of background gradient. Possible brief, stylized preloader (animated logo or cellular pattern).

*   **Data Visualizations:** Animated charts/graphs (bars grow, lines draw, points appear) as they scroll into view.
*   **Section Transitions:** Smooth transitions between content sections (fade, background color shift, shape wipe).

### Interactive Elements

*   **Hover Effects (General Elements):** Quick, responsive feedback on interactive elements (slight lift/scale, glow with accent colors, border/background change).
*   **CTA Buttons Interaction:** Distinct hover state (background/text color change, pulse/glow). Brief press-down animation on click.
*   **Form Fields Interaction:** Clear focus states (border color change, inner shadow, label animation). Gentle animations for validation feedback.
